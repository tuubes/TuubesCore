# Contributing

Hello and thank you for your interest in the Photon project!

Photon follows the classic [fork & pull](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) model: when you want to modify something, you fork the official repository, develop your feature or bugfix, and submit a Pull Request.

This file is here to answer your questions about the contribution to the project.

## What can I help you with?

Look at the [current issues](https://github.com/mcphoton/Photon-Server/issues) to see what the pending/ongoing tasks are. You can help with:

- The code itself: develop new features or fix bugs, in Java or Scala (decent skills required).
- The code's documentation: explain what the code does.
- [The project's wiki](https://github.com/mcphoton/Photon-Server/wiki): explain how the different parts of Photon works, like plugins, commands, etc.
- Something else: You think about something else that can benefit the project? You're welcome to discuss it on the [discord server](https://discord.gg/vWYembz)!

## What should I do before contributing?

1. [Setup the project](README.md#Project%20Setup).
2. If you code, read the **mandatory** [coding style](Coding%20Style.md) and configure your IDE to respect it.
3. Read [the wiki](https://github.com/mcphoton/Photon-Server/wiki) to learn more about the project's internals.
4. Join the [discord server](https://discord.gg/vWYembz). Of course, I won't force you to do it (and I won't discriminate your pull requests if you don't join the discord that would not be nice), but it's really useful to ask questions and discuss about the project.

## I've found a bug, how do I report it?

1. [Check](https://github.com/mcphoton/Photon-Server/issues) that this bug hasn't been reported already.
2. [Report](https://github.com/mcphoton/Photon-Server/issues/new) it by creating a new issue.

## I have a question!

Ask it on the [discord server](https://discord.gg/vWYembz) (yeah, I insist on the discord ^^) and I'll be happy to answer.
